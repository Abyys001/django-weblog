# weblog-django
Well, after learning Python, which I enjoyed a lot,
I got acquainted with frameworks and realized that I have a whole other subject to learn. 
So I got to work and created a learning project for myself so that I can learn Django and have a good repository :D

## What is this repository?

This blog is like all other blogs that have apps like post and profile. But honestly, 
I can't have something and not make it special,
so you will probably see a series of interesting methods and patterns that I learned from different places and I'm using them here.
